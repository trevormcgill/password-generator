# Password Generator

## Description
In this challenge, the goal was to modify starter code to create a random password generator. I needed to write the necessary variables and functions to prompt users for their desired password criteria such as: password length and the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. <br> <br> I used the functions prompt() and confirm() to have users select the criteria and then I used a 'for' loop with a randomIndex variable that included the methods Math.floor() and Math.random() to generate a random password that met the user's criteria.
